# Neuhon

Mini-thesis on key signature detection, where both accuracy and efficiency of 
different algorithms are discussed. Python has been used for prototyping and research purposes only : the final end-user program is available in Clojure only.

## How to use Neuhon

```clj
    (use 'neuhon.core)

    ;; Predict the key of all files located in path/to/your/wave/folder
    (process-all "path/to/your/wave/folder")
```
